# ShadyAddonsReborn

> [!NOTE]
> ## What (was) this mod?
> This was my fork of [ShadyAddons](https://github.com/ShadyAddons/ShadyAddons/tree/main]). <br>
> I loved ShadyAddons for the *"innocent"* cheats and the unique game experience it provided. <br>
> I made this fork because the original mod is no longer maintained. Thanks GPL-2.0!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## What's changed?
> - Removed many of the original features that I either never used or found unnecessary/too much blatant.
> - Focused on retaining and improving core features that I liked about Shady.

> [!TIP]
> ## What's next?
> * Now that Hypixel Skyblock no longer supports 1.8.9, I have made my own QoL mod: [GiovanniClient](https://github.com/GiovanniClient/giovanni-client/tree/main])
