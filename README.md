## What is this?
This is my fork of [ShadyAddons](https://github.com/ShadyAddons/ShadyAddons/tree/main]). I loved ShadyAddons for the *"innocent"* cheats and the unique game experience it provided. I decided to fork the repo because the original mod is no longer maintained, many features are broken, and you can't even join skyblock with Shady because of its `modid`. So, thanks to its GPL-2.0 license, I am able to revive the project with my personal touch.

## What's changed?
- Removed many of the original features that I either never used or found unnecessary/too much blatant.
- Focused on retaining and improving core features that I liked about Shady.

## What's next?
* I would like to port the config menu to [OneConfig](https://polyfrost.org/projects/oneconfig/)
* Add new features! Feel free to give suggestions, maybe open an issue or DM me
* Make the mod more Team Rocket themed
