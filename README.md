# ShadyAddonsReborn

> [!NOTE]
> ## What is this?
> This is my fork of [ShadyAddons](https://github.com/ShadyAddons/ShadyAddons/tree/main]). <br>
> I loved ShadyAddons for the *"innocent"* cheats and the unique game experience it provided. <br>
> I made this fork because the original mod is no longer maintained. Thanks GPL-2.0!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## What's changed?
> - Removed many of the original features that I either never used or found unnecessary/too much blatant.
> - Focused on retaining and improving core features that I liked about Shady.

> [!TIP]
> ## What's next?
> * Porting ShadyAddons to 1.20+ so that it is compatible with the Foraging Update
> * Add new features! Feel free to give suggestions, maybe open an issue or DM me (I will NOT add blatant or risky features, this is made to be safe-ish to use)
> * Make the mod more Team Rocket themed
