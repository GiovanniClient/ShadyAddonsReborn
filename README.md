## What is this?
I was a fan of ShadyAddons for the *"innocent"* cheats and the unique experience it provided. This is my fork of [ShadyAddons](https://github.com/ShadyAddons/ShadyAddons/tree/main]), originally the most popular Quality-of-Life[^qol] mod for [Hypixel SkyBlock](https://hypixel.net/categories/skyblock.194/). I decided to fork this repository because the original mod is no longer maintained, many features are broken, and you can't even join skyblock if you use Shady because of its `modid`. Thanks to its GPL-2.0 license, I am able to revive the project with my personal touch.

## What's changed?
- Removed many of the original features that I either never used or found unnecessary/too much blatant.
- Focused on retaining and improving core features that made ShadyAddons enjoyable and useful to me.

## What's next?
* I would like to port the config menu to [OneConfig](https://polyfrost.org/projects/oneconfig/)
* Add new features! Feel free to give suggestions, maybe open an issue or DM me
* Make the mod more Team Rocket themed
